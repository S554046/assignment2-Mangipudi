###### My favourite team sport is BASKETBALL

The pace of play in ***basketball is incredibly quick and thrilling***. On the court, every player has the opportunity to play both offense and defense. Basketball is a game that can be played anywhere as all you need is a ball and a hoop.***Basketball can be practiced easily with one person making it easy to learn.***
